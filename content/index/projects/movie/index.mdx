Website for adding reviews and sharing your ratings with other movie lovers. A fully functioning application built using PHP in the backend. User authentication and authorization implemented. User credentials are secured by hashing. 
Anybody can create user account and start becoming a critic. User with role admin has all the power to add,remove movies and users.
MySQL database has been used for storing movie as well as users information.

As this project was built using vanilla PHP, it really rooted my understanding of full stack development. After completion of this project, my idea of SDLC, agile methodology and teamwork skills were firmly developed.
