Being a huge admirer of hackernews(https://news.ycombinator.com/). I built this application as my hobby project. The top 20 stories are fetched from hacker news and stored in redux store. Then, redux store supplies those stories to React. 

Fun Fact: Top stories keep changing based on comments and karmas.
