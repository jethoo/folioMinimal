Tattoo Art is a project completed by four software developers. This project was created through the Hatchways Career Accelerator Program. Tattoo Art was built using scrum methodologies. The idea of this website is to have a place, to not only create contests in order to come out with a new tattoo design, but 
also for the designers to show off their work and artistic view. We have also added messaging feature which will allow contest owners to speak freely with the designers working on a contest.
