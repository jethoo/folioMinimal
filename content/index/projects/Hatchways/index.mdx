Data is being fetched from an api. I used React to achieve the final view. Similarly, Redux was used to manage the state. By using 'Search by Name' field, students can be searched based on their firstname and lastname.
Information about grades can be viewed by clicking the expandable button. 

'Add a tag' field can be used to add any custom information to a particular student and 'Search by tags' search field can be used to find student
based on that manually entered tags.

This project was built as part of a company's internal project, therefore I have not made the source code public. Please feel free to contact me if you want to know more about this project.
